Introduction
------------

FSBench is a script designed to run IOZone multiple times and collect the results in convenient tarballs.

A result reader script is provided that will load up the results and generate a nice LaTeX document with somewhat fancy plots, legends, and a table of contents.

This is a very rough tool for now, but it does the job.

Requirements
------------

- Ruby 1.8 or 1.9
- pdfLaTeX (tested with TeXLive)
- LaTeX PGF, TIKZ and PGFPlots packages
- iozone (binary alongside the scripts - or symbolic link)

- okular (that's hardcoded ...)

Tarball naming
--------------

Result tarballs (rtars) don't have to be in the same directory.
Tarball names follow this pattern : PREFIX-M.N.tbz2

PREFIX will be used as label while generating report.
You are advised to put a summary of your testing variables :
ext4-2.6.30 vs ext4-2.6.35 ; afs-infiniband vs afs-gbe ...

PREFIX can be set using the --tarball-prefix (-p) parameter of fs_bench.rb
If you don't manually set it up, it will use `uname -n`-`uname -m`-fsbench
You can use rename (1) afterwards to bulk rename result tarballs.

Usage
-----

1) Ensure iozone is located alongside the scripts
   (if you have installed it through your package manager,
    "ln -s `which iozone`" should do the trick)

2) Open the scripts in your favorite editor prior using them

3) fs_bench.rb -t <test-directory>
   <test-directory> must be somewhere on the filesystem you wish to test

   See fs_bench.rb --help for all options

4) repeat 3. on each filesystem you wish to test

5) run "./result_reader.rb ~/fsbench-results/*" and wait for okular to open your pdf
   you can use fancier globs
   try "./result_reader.rb --help"

Known Issues
------------

- Lots of ugly constants, lots of hardcoded stuff.
- PDF generation takes quite a lot of time (2/3 passes ...)
- Plots can generate overful hboxes if you're using too much plot points
- Plots have some glitches
- Plots with more than 6 datasets have even more glitches
