Introduction
------------

FSBench is a script designed to run IOZone multiple times and collect the results in convenient tarballs.

A result reader script is provided that will load up the results and generate a nice LaTeX document with somewhat fancy plots, legends, and a table of contents.

This is a very rough tool for now, but it does the job.

Requirements
------------

- Ruby 1.8 or 1.9
- pdfLaTeX (tested with TeXLive)
- LaTeX PGF, TIKZ and PGFPlots packages
- iozone (binary alongside the scripts - or symbolic link)

- okular (that's hardcoded ...)

Usage
-----

1) Ensure iozone is located alongside the scripts
   (if you have installed it through your package manager,
    "ln -s `which iozone`" should do the trick)

2) Open the scripts in your favorite editor prior using them

3) fs_bench.rb <tarball-name-tag> <temporary-directory>
   <temporary-directory> must be somewhere on the filesystem you wish to test
   <tarball-name-tag> will be the part of the legend for collected data

   results default to ~/fsbench-results (constant for now)
   each tests are run 3x5 times (non customizable either)

4) repeat 3. on each filesystem you wish to test

5) run "./result_reader.rb ~/fsbench-results/*" and wait for okular to open your pdf
   you can use fancier globs
   try "./result_reader.rb --help"

Known Issues
------------

- No proper getopts as of now, lots of ugly constants, lots of hardcoded stuff.
- PDF generation takes quite a lot of time (3 passes ...)
- Plots can generate overful hboxes if you're using too much plot points
- Plots have some glitches
- Plots with more than 6 datasets have even more glitches
